	<h3>Facts About The Earth</h3>
	
	<ul>

		<li><strong>The Earth’s rotation is gradually slowing:</strong>
		This deceleration is happening almost 
		imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds
		per hundred years, although the rate at which it 
		occurs is not perfectly uniform. This has the 
		effect of lengthening our days, but it happens 
		so slowly that it could be as much as 140 
		million years before the length of a day will 
		have increased to 25 hours.</li><br/>

		<li><strong>The Earth was once believed to be the centre 
		of the universe:</strong> Due to the apparent movements 
		of the Sun and planets in relation to 
		their viewpoint, ancient scientists insisted 
		that the Earth remained static, whilst other 
		celestial bodies travelled in circular orbits 
		around it. Eventually, the view that the Sun was
		at the centre of the universe was postulated by
		Copernicus, though this is also not the case.</li><br/>

		<li><strong>Earth has a powerful magnetic field:</strong>
		This phenomenon is caused by the nickel-iron 
		core of the planet, coupled with its rapid 
		rotation. This field protects the Earth from 
		the effects of solar wind.
		</li><br/>

		<li><strong>There is only one natural satellite of the planet Earth:</strong>
		As a percentage of the size of the body it orbits, the Moon 
		is the largest satellite of any planet in our solar system. 
		In real terms, however, it is only the fifth largest 
		natural satellite.</li><br/>

		<li><strong>Earth is the only planet not named after a god:</strong>
		The other seven planets in our solar system are all named 
		after Roman gods or goddesses. Although only Mercury, Venus,
		Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were named during ancient times,
		because they were visible to the naked eye, the Roman method of 
		naming planets was retained after the discovery of Uranus 
		and Neptune.</li><br/>

		<li><strong>The Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System:</strong>
		This varies according to the part of the planet; for example,
		the metallic core is denser than the crust. The average 
		density of the Earth is approximately 5.52 grams per 
		cubic centimetre.</li>
